- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ptnoire
- - I am currently learning JavaScript and Python.
- - - - There are a lot of languages I am excited to learn.
- Very eager to get more experience with the culture of coding.
Keeping it simple. Trying to do something different with my career.

Maybe a lot of this seems simple or easy but that is okay.
- Someday I hope to look back at my old work and see how I've improved.
- - This is an exciting field to get into if you're eager to explore.

I have a lot of projects that are ongoing and in progress, I am a avid supporter of the FGC
in my free time, I devote a lot of time to helping my local scenes and community thrive in any way I can.
