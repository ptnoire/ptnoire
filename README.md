I would love to help with your open-source projects, please hit me up!

I have a lot of projects that are ongoing and in progress, I am a avid supporter of the FGC
in my free time, I devote a lot of time to helping my local scenes and community thrive in any way I can.

Current Projects:
- mySQL + Node.JS Custom Library (Importable Modules)
- PAYD : A simple bill tracker for the people, no ads, no nonsense.
